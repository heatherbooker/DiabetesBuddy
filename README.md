# Diabetes Buddy

### a project by [Stephanie](https://github.com/steph-rage) & [Suhui](https://github.com/suhuiii) & me!
This Android app is for people with diabetes who need to measure their blood sugar regularly by pricking their fingers. It helps them keep track of which fingers were pricked last to minimize pain of re-pricking the same fingers accidentally! We hope it makes lives better. :)

TO USE:
open android studio
from first menu, select check out project from version control
or, if you have a current project already open:
from top menu, select VCS -> checkout from version control -> github

TO SYNC to a local phone:
follow instructions [from 2nd answer here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9210152/set-up-device-for-development-no-permissions)
from top menu in Android Studio, run and select the plugged in phone
may need to open tools -> android -> sdk manager and install the same OS as is on the phone

WHEE!
